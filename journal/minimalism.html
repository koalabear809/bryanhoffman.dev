<p><em>Simplicity is good.</em></p>
<p>As I prepare for my move across the country, I am beginning to go through my belongings and see which ones I will keep, and which ones I will sell.
What I&#39;ve found had surprised me - I have a lot of stuff that I don&#39;t use. I have a lot of stuff that I don&#39;t need. I have a lot of stuff that I <i>don&#39;t even want</i>.
About 80% of my stuff I could easily live without.</p>
<p>So I&#39;ve sold some stuff, donated some, and my room is starting to feel empty. I feel a sense of peculiar freedom. No longer
must I find a place for everything. I can keep my room clean more easily. I feel less distracted. I&#39;m being more productive with less.</p>
<p>This simplicity is showing itself in other areas of my life. In the code I write, in the food I cook. I yearn to rid my life of
unneeded complexity.</p>
