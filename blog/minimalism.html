    <h1>Minimalism</h1>
    <h4>Simplicity is good.</h4>
    <div>
     <p>As I prepare for my move across the country, I am beginning to go through my 
      belongings and see which ones I will keep, and which ones I will sell. What 
      I&#39;ve found had surprised me - I have a lot of stuff that I don&#39;t use. I 
      have a lot of stuff that I don&#39;t need. I have a lot of stuff that I 
      don&#39;t even want. About 80% of my stuff I could easily live without.
     <p>So I&#39;ve sold some stuff, donated some, and my room is starting to feel 
      empty. I feel a sense of peculiar freedom. No longer must I find a place for 
      everything. I can keep my room clean more easily. I feel less distracted. 
      I&#39;m being more productive with less.
     <p>This simplicity is showing itself in other areas of my life. In the code I 
      write, in the food I cook. I yearn to rid my life of unneeded complexity.
